## \#VizLou

\#VizLou helps visionary young adults share what they love about living in Louisville, and their ideas for the future. Discovering and sharing visions happens [over Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vizlou&src=typd) and directly at [vizlou.org](http://vizlou.org). City leadership and staff, community leaders, and other adult allies can use the tool to share visions they like, offer comments and help make connections.

\#VizLou is an experimental new tool for civic engagement, created in partnership with Louisville Metro, with support from Living Cities. [Read more about the project](http://www.livingcities.org/blog/?id=90).
